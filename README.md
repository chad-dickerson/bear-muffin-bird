# Bear🐻 Muffin🧁 Bird🐦

This is a small activity for FE1 students to help reinforce event bubbling and delegation.

## Set Up

Clone this repository down and run locally with `open index.html`.

## Existing Code

Before jumping in to work, get a lay of the code base. Get the project up and running, explore what it does in the browser. Skim through the code so you have a feel for how the currently funcionality has been achieved.

## Task

Your task is to add in delete functionality. 

**Level 1:** When a bear, muffin, or bird emoji has been clicked on, it should be removed from the DOM.
**Level 2:** Bears are known for being stubborn. Modify the functionality so that only birds and muffins can be removed. When a bear is clicked on, the user should see "GRRRR" appear under the specific bear that was clicked on.
